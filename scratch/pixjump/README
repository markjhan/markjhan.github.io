Pixjump is a game. 

HOW TO PLAY:
1. Press arrow keys to move the square to hit the hexagon. 
2. You get some initial scores at the beginning and lose some if you hit the green color area. 
3. You can jump over, stay, and move in the black color area. Once you hit the hexagon, you go to the next scene. 
4. After you pass all scenes without using up all the scores, you win!

Good luck!
